Hi [First Name],

I came across [Company Name] while researching [industry] businesses in [City].

I noticed your website could use a refresh — [specific observation: e.g., "it's not mobile-friendly" or "the design looks a bit dated"].

Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company Name]'s website

Hi [First Name],

Just floating this back to the top of your inbox.

A few [industry] businesses we've worked with were surprised how affordable and quick a website refresh can be — we're talking $1,000 and about a week.

Happy to share examples if helpful.

[Name]
```

### Email 3: Breakup
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I'll assume the timing isn't right and close out your file on my end.
